  Compress natural-language memory files (MEMORY.md, todos, preferences) into caveman format to
  save input tokens (PASSIVE-first). AUTO-TRIGGER: user asks to compress/shrink a memory or prefs
  file, or to save tokens on MEMORY.md / CLAUDE.md / todos — confirm then run. Explicit:
  "/caveman-compress FILEPATH" or "compress memory file". Confirm before overwriting MEMORY.md
  (sensitive sections). Backup: FILE.original.md beside source (manual path local-only).

# Caveman Compress

## Purpose

Compress natural language files into caveman-speak to reduce input tokens. Overwrites original. Backup: `<filename>.original.md`.

## Trigger

**Passive:** user asks to compress a memory/prefs file or save tokens on one → confirm, then run. Explicit: `/caveman-compress <filepath>`.

## Process（OpenCode 适配：默认模型手工压缩）

默认走**模型手工压缩**（本地、无外发）：

> **目标**：本机记忆文件（MEMORY.md）等自然语言记忆/偏好/待办文件。**压缩 MEMORY.md 前必须先征得用户确认**——该文件可能含敏感段；手工路径全程本地。

> **备份双路径**：手工路径=同目录 `<file>.original.md`；可选 CLI 路径=`%LOCALAPPDATA%\caveman-compress\backups\<父目录>\`（置于源目录之外，防 auto-loader 重吞备份）。

1. 备份：先复制原文件为 `<file>.original.md`
2. 读全文，仅压缩散文部分，严格按下方 Compression Rules 执行（代码/URL/路径/命令/数字逐字保留）
3. 覆盖写回原文件（不碰备份）
4. 返回：新文件路径 + 备份路径 + 压缩前后字符数对比

可选 CLI 路径（仅当已配置 ANTHROPIC_API_KEY 或 claude CLI 时）：在本 SKILL 基目录（`caveman-compress\`，cwd=skill 基目录）运行 `python -m scripts <absolute_filepath>`（Windows 无 `python3` 命令），脚本自动检测环境；失败则回退上述手工压缩。

## Compression Rules

### Remove
- Articles: a, an, the
- Filler: just, really, basically, actually, simply, essentially, generally
- Pleasantries: "sure", "certainly", "of course", "happy to", "I'd recommend"
- Hedging: "it might be worth", "you could consider", "it would be good to"
- Redundant phrasing: "in order to" → "to", "make sure to" → "ensure", "the reason is because" → "because"
- Connective fluff: "however", "furthermore", "additionally", "in addition"

### Preserve EXACTLY (never modify)
- Code blocks (fenced ``` and indented)
- Inline code (`backtick content`)
- URLs and links (full URLs, markdown links)
- File paths (`/src/components/...`, `./config.yaml`)
- Commands (`npm install`, `git commit`, `docker build`)
- Technical terms (library names, API names, protocols, algorithms)
- Proper nouns (project names, people, companies)
- Dates, version numbers, numeric values
- Environment variables (`$HOME`, `NODE_ENV`)

### Preserve Structure
- All markdown headings (keep exact heading text, compress body below)
- Bullet point hierarchy (keep nesting level)
- Numbered lists (keep numbering)
- Tables (compress cell text, keep structure)
- Frontmatter/YAML headers in markdown files

### Compress
- Use short synonyms: "big" not "extensive", "fix" not "implement a solution for", "use" not "utilize"
- Fragments OK: "Run tests before commit" not "You should always run tests before committing"
- Drop "you should", "make sure to", "remember to" — just state the action
- Merge redundant bullets that say the same thing differently
- Keep one example where multiple examples show the same pattern

CRITICAL RULE:
Anything inside ``` ... ``` must be copied EXACTLY.
Do not:
- remove comments
- remove spacing
- reorder lines
- shorten commands
- simplify anything

Inline code (`...`) must be preserved EXACTLY.
Do not modify anything inside backticks.

If file contains code blocks:
- Treat code blocks as read-only regions
- Only compress text outside them
- Do not merge sections around code

## Pattern

Original:
> You should always make sure to run the test suite before pushing any changes to the main branch. This is important because it helps catch bugs early and prevents broken builds from being deployed to production.

Compressed:
> Run tests before push to main. Catch bugs early, prevent broken prod deploys.

Original:
> The application uses a microservices architecture with the following components. The API gateway handles all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate service. The authentication service is responsible for managing user sessions and JWT tokens.

Compressed:
> Microservices architecture. API gateway route all requests to services. Auth service manage user sessions + JWT tokens.

## Boundaries

- ONLY compress natural language files (.md, .txt, .typ, .typst, .tex, extensionless)
- NEVER modify: .py, .js, .ts, .json, .yaml, .yml, .toml, .env, .lock, .css, .html, .xml, .sql, .sh
- If file has mixed content (prose + code), compress ONLY the prose sections
- If unsure whether something is code or prose, leave it unchanged
- Original file is backed up as FILE.original.md before overwriting
- Never compress FILE.original.md (skip it)
